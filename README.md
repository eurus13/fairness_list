NAMES ARE REDACTED FOR STUDENT PRIVACY

A friend was charged with scheduling students for clinical hours. She made a google sheet which was first come self signup for the students.
After the list was complete, the head of the department wanted the hours changed which ruined the list.

To keep things fair I suggested we look at the total number of shifts each student had and the time they entered the google sheets 
to signup so that every student could at least get the minimum hours required for credit but also reward the students who signed up first
with the best spots.
