**NAMES ARE REDACTED FOR STUDENT PRIVACY**

A friend was charged with scheduling students for clinical hours for nursing students. She made a google sheet which was first come self signup for the students. All went well and the schedule was complete.

After the list was sent to her boss, the head of the department wanted the hours changed which ruined the list and caused a bit of chaos since:

1. Next semester class schedules had been set 
2. There is a mandatory minimum of hours required for graduation next semester, and now some students are unable to get hours
3. It was first come first serve with some students having far more hours than needed to graduate.



I made a suggestion that to attempt to keep things fair with a visible thought process to aid in the redesign that we:


1.Make a table with columns for timestamp data for each student with their first edit in google sheets and a column with the total number of shifts taken so we can still reward the early birds, while taking into account that some people had excess nonessential hours they signed up for.

2. Cap all students at the minimum number of hours until all students are allowed to resign up (prioirity access given based of time stamp data)

Then if needed we could tweak and discuss on case by case basis if everyone still didn't have a spot. 

3. After everyone has minimum hours needed, we then open the rest of the slots for anyone to signup for.
